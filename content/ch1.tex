\section{Introduction}

\par Applied mathematics is concerned with the design and analysis of algorithms or programs. The systematic treatment of complex algorithms requires a suitable programming language for their description, and such a programming language should be concise, precise, consistent over a wide area of application, mnemonic, and economical of symbols; it should exhibit clearly the constraints on the sequence in which operations are performed; and it should permit the description of a process to be independent of the particular representation chosen for the data.
