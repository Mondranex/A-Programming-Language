\chapter*{PREFACE}

\par Applied mathematics is largely concerned with the design and analysis of explicit procedures for calculating the exact or approximate values of various functions. Such explicit procedures are called algorithms or \textit{programs}. Because an effective notation for the description of programs exhibits considerable syntactic structure, it is called a \textit{programming language}.
